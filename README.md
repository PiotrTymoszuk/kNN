# kNN
k-nearest neighbor prediction for binary outcome and various distance measures

A set of R functions used to generate kNN predictions of a any factorized outcome with various distance measures provided by distance() function from package philentropy and to test prediction accuracy (rates of correct predictions, error rates, sensitivity and specificity). New: naive Bayes classification (provided by e1071 package) and distance weighted kNN were implemented as well.
